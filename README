##Limitations and Bugs

1. Using connectors without arguments in between(e.g. &&&&) will cause segmentation fault.
2. Running commands that have character(s) which is(are) also included in connectors will not be recognized and cause an error.
3. Colors for files, directories, etc. are not supported.
4. Right and left arrow cannot move cursor when inputting commands.
5. Up and down arrow cannot get previous commands. 
6. If the string after echo includes connectors, an execution fault will occur. 
7. When using "[" and "]" to test direcotry or files, we need to use space to split the command with "[" and "]". E.g. "[ -e src/Command.h ]".
8. The rshell can not detect whether the brackets "(" and ")" match or not.
